# filesToScrape
Please note that the pipeline.py file's method override of the file_path method also was coded to handle the requirements of an additional practice spider called logstoScrape.py, which downloads the scrapy execution log of a spider that resides on Heroku with scrapyd being the dyno.
Hence, logstoscrape.py is also included in this git repository.
